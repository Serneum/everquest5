Overworld
==========

A text-based game using Java Swing for basic UI.

The first game I ever wrote. The name was just something that came out of the blue because there was nothing else that I
could think of at the time. It's a simple game based on a style similar to Legend of the Green Dragon, and therefore also
Legend of the Red Dragon.
